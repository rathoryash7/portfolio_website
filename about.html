                            <p>
                                My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for computers and problem-solving during my high school years. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at ABES Engineering College, where I delved deep into programming languages, algorithms, and software development.

                                During my college years, I worked on various projects that solidified my interest in full-stack development and data science. One of my significant projects was a disease prediction system, where I utilized machine learning to create a tool for early disease detection and personalized doctor recommendations. This project not only honed my technical skills but also ignited my desire to use technology for social good.
                                
                                My curiosity and eagerness to learn new technologies propelled me to explore mobile app development. I developed a doctor appointment system using the MERN stack, which further sharpened my skills in full-stack development and real-time authentication systems.
                                
                                To broaden my expertise, I took up certifications from IBM, Cisco, and other reputed institutions, diving into data science, cybersecurity, and blockchain development. These certifications equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the latest technological advancements and industry best practices.
                                
                                Currently, I am working as an intern, gaining hands-on experience in Databricks, ETL, and Power BI. This role has been instrumental in enhancing my data visualization and analytics capabilities, allowing me to create insightful reports and dashboards.
                                
                                My journey so far has been a blend of continuous learning, hands-on projects, and a relentless drive to innovate. Each step has brought me closer to my goal of building impactful and transformative technological solutions.
